This repo contains code for our paper titled "Object Representations Using Tensor Products in Vision Transformers" (under review at ICIP 2022).
Our code builds upon that of the [TP-Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06611) and [Vision Transformer](https://research.google/pubs/pub50650/).

## Usage
The ```tp_vit.py``` file contains modeling code, while ```training.py``` contains code for training the model on ImageNet.
